This blog is really a personal journal. I explore economics and theology as a hobby, and I needed an outlet.

Regarding the title: Let's be honest, Jesus pursues me. You could say my "part" in the redemption story was that I didn't run away at full speed. His grace compelled me. His kindness won me over. Despite my best effort, he won.
