My hope on this Earth does not and cannot lie in the outcome of any particular event. In this life, some things will swing in my favor and others will not. Sometimes things will swing in the favor of justice, sometimes they won't. My hope is in Christ alone. Some Christians have led peaceful, wealthy lives. Some Christians have been beheaded or burned alive. If your hope is in the outcome of a crisis you are facing, you will not succeed. Pray for favor. Pray for justice. But most importantly, pray that your hope would be found in Christ. This is the only way to find peace in the storm. Or more realistically, this is the only way to maintain your sanity and innocence amidst the chaos of sin.
