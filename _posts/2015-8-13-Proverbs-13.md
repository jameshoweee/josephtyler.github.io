title: Appearance of wealth
---

I've learned from my experience and from watching those around me that those who struggle to manage money do so because they are more concerned with appearing wealthy than being wealthy. For those concerned with appearing wealthy there are many solutions - buying things on credit being the most effective.

Proverbs 13 says

>"One person pretends to be rich, yet has nothing;
another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth."

This is quite the irony. Those who appear poor are often rich, and those who appear rich are often poor. Appearance is deceiving.

But even more interesting to me is that the path to wealth seems to begin by giving up concern about appearance. If the goal is to be wealthy so that you can look wealthy, you will likely be neither in the end.
