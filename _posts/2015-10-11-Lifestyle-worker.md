The ultimate test of self-control is habit. Habit requires consistency. It requires persistence despite the circumstances. Habits are immune to excuses. The ability to develop a good habit is how a life changes.
The most important habit to form is daily communion with our creator. From this habit we can truly know what is good. From this habit we can begin to develop other worthwhile habits.
