title: The will of the father
---

In Matthew 7, Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my father in heaven." He continues to warn that many will claim that they prophesied, cast out demons, and performed miracles in his name, yet this is insufficient. This tells me two things.

First, those who claimed to do miracles in his name were not doing the will of the Father. It's possible that God's will for you may at some point involve miracles, mysteries, or otherwise mystical events. But his will cannot be reduced to such things.

Second, it's important to seek and know the will of the Father. This is a complex subject, and the reality is that we will never master the art of knowing His will. But the choice is active participation verses passive indifference. In Luke 9, Jesus says, "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me." The pursuit of God's will is an active, daily decision.
