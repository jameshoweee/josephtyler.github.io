title: Everything I want in a blog
---

I've had a few different blogs - all on WordPress. WordPress is an excellent blogging platform, but at this point in my life I need something a little more interesting. I started using a static site generator called Jekyll Now. This allows me write my posts in markdown using Vim and publish via Github.

This blog will be the overflow of all important things in my life - faith, family, programming, and finance.
